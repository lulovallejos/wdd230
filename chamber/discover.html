        <h1>Women's Bridge</h1>
        <p>
          El Puente de la Mujer (Women's Bridge) is one of the most famous landmarks in the neighbourhood of Puerto Madero. The rotating footbridge was the first work from Valencian architect Santiago Calatrava in Latin America and demonstrates Buenos Aires' constant effort to position itself at the vanguard of art and architecture in the region.

          The bridge represents a couple dancing tango, with the white mast symbolising the man and the curve of the bridge, the woman. It has a large turning mechanism, allowing it to swing open to allow sailing ships to pass. The bridge was constructed in Spain and donated to Buenos Aires through a private donation.</p>

        <h1>Caminito</h1>
        <p>
          Located in La boca, the Caminito (little path, in Spanish) is a street museum of colourful painted houses typical of the immigrant dwellings that came to chracterise this portside area towards the end of the 19th and start of the 20th century.

          The Caminito followed the route of an old stream that once flowed into the Riachuelo, and later, after the river dried up, formed part of a railroad route. After the closure of the railroad, the street was largely abandoned until in the 1950s a group of neighbours decided to regenerate the area and local artist Benito Quinquela Mart√≠n began using the tenements as his canvas.</p>

        <h1>Floralis Generica</h1>
        <p>
          Named "Floralis Gen√©rica" in homage to all flowers, this 20m-high, 18-tonne aluminium and stainless steel sculpture dominates the Plaza de las Naciones Unidas.

          Unveiled in the year 2002, it was probably the world's first mobile public sculpture to be controlled by hydraulics and photoelectric sensors. It was donated to the city of Buenos Aires by its creator, the Argentine architect Eduardo Catalano, who in this piece realised his dream of creating a sculpture that would reflect the dynamism of time. Catalano once said the sculpture was "a synthesis of all the flowers and a hope that is reborn every day."
          
          The six steel petals open at 8am each morning, and close at midnight. The petals also close in high winds in order to protect the sculpture, while on patriotic holidays they remain open all day.</p>

        <h1>Theatre Colon</h1>
        <p>
          Renowned for its phenomenal acoustics and stunning architecture, the Col√≥n theatre is considered one of the best opera houses in the world, together with La Scala in Mil√°n, the Opera Garnier in Paris and the Royal Opera House in London.

          Designed by Francesco Tamburini, Victor Meano and Jules Dormal, and built over 20 years, the theatre opened in 1908 and went on to host some of the most important conductors, singers and dancers of the twentieth century, including Igor Stravinsky, Herbert von Karajan, Daniel Barenboim, Maria Callas, Luciano Pavarotti, Pl√°cido Domingo, Rudolf Nureyev, Julio Bocca and Maximiliano Guerra.</p>

        <h1>Narrowest house</h1>
        <p>
          Measuring just two-and-a-half metres in width, the Casa M√≠nima in San Telmo is famous for being the narrowest house in the city.

          It was part of a home built in the 1820s and has a simple facade with a green door and a balcony with iron bars.
          
          These small houses were believed to have been built for freed slaves, who, on receiving their freedom, were granted small pieces of land adjoining the homes of their former masters. This is the only remaining example in Buenos Aires.
